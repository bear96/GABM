Step,Description
1,Initialize the simulation by creating the world and its agents
2,"At the beginning of each time step, agents independently decide whether to stay home or go outside"
3,"For agents who decide to go outside, calculate potential interaction partners by identifying agents also present on grid"
4,"Allow agents to interact with their potential partners, potentially infecting them based on the infection_rate"
5,Update the state of the agents and the world based on their actions and interactions during the day
6,Calculate the daily new cases by tallying the number of agents who have reached the fourth day of their infection
7,Provide the daily new cases as feedback to agents at the beginning of the next time step
8,"Save the entire world, including agents and their attributes, into a local file as a checkpoint at the end of each time step"
9,"Check for an early stopping condition: if there are no infected agents for three consecutive days, save the final checkpoint and halt the simulation"
