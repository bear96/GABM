# GABM-SIR
This study offers a new paradigm of individual-level modeling to address the grand challenge of incorporating human behavior in epidemic models. By utilizing generative artificial intelligence in an agent-based epidemic model, each agent is empowered to make its own reasonings and decisions via connecting to a large language model like ChatGPT. Through various simulation experiments, we present compelling evidence that generative agents mimic real-world behaviors such as quarantining when sick, and self-isolation when cases rise. Collectively, the agents demonstrate patterns akin to multiple waves observed in recent pandemics followed by a period of endemic. Moreover, the agents successfully flatten the epidemic curve. This study opens up a potential to improve dynamic system modeling by offering a way to represent human brain, reasoning, and decision making.
